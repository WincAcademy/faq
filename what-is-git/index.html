<h1 id="what-is-git">What is git?</h1>
<p>Git is a tool to do version control system. Let's take this term apart without
worrying about commands or code too much.</p>
<p>Imagine you're writing some code to solve a problem. After working on it for a
while it works well and you're happy with it. Great! Your problem is solved.</p>
<p>Then, after using it for a while, you think of some extra features you'd like
to add to your existing code. You implement the features and test your code.
It doesn't work, but you're out of time for today. In fact, it's not just that
the new features don't work, <em>nothing works</em> anymore. Now your whole program is
broken and your original problem is back.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could <em>revert</em> to an earlier version? That's a type
of operation that git is for. In fact, it can do a lot more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide an overview of the differences between one version and another.</li>
<li>Merge different versions of your code into one.</li>
<li>Split one version of your code into multiple different versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this can be done by the <code>git</code> tool.</p>
