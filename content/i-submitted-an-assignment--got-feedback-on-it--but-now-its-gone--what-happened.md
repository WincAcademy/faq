# I submitted an assignment, got feedback on it, but now it's gone, what happened?


This situation can happen in the Winc Board.

This situation occurs if the following steps are taken:

- student submits an assignment
- teacher or teacher assistant gives feedback and sets the assignment to 'not-passed'
- the student gets an email telling them there's feedback
- the student opens the link to the Winc Board
- 💥 the student presses the button 'Modify your answer'
- both the original submisssion and the original feedback are now no longer available for the student or the teachers/teacher assistants

When the student resubmits the assignment the teacher can see the old submission again.

**What to do if this happens to you:**

Inform the teacher or teacher's assistant that this (☝️) happened and ask them for the feedback they sent you. They'll send it and then you can improve your code and resubmit.
