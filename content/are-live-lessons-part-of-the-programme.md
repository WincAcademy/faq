# Are live lessons part of the programme?


Live-lessons are not strictly part of the programme. They can be seen as supportive material. You don't need to attend or rewatch any live-lesson to finish a course.

However, during live lessons we almost always treat subjects that are very central to our courses. We try to make these as valuable and interesting as possible for anyone doing a course at Winc. Whether you watch them live or view the recorded live-lesson.
