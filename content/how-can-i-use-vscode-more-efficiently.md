# How can I use VSCode more efficiently?

One way to become more efficient in using VSCode is to learn its keyboard shortcuts.
There are a tonne of them and you can even customize them to your liking.

Another word for keyboard shortcut is "key binding", which is what they call it in the VS Code
documentation.

For some tips see [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

If you just want an overview [download a
PDF](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference)
with most of the keyboard shortcuts and keep it close by, maybe even print it
out.

If you prefer video over reading documentation this is a good one:
