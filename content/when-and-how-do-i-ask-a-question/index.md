# When and how do I ask a question?


If you're doing a course at Winc Academy it's very normal to have (a lot of) questions. It's very common to get stuck with an exercise (oefening) or assignment (opdracht).

It's also good to know: as teachers and teachers assistants we sincerely LOVE to help you. That's why we chose to do this work after all üòä

As teachers and teachers assistants we want to help you become the best developer/programmer/technical person you can be. This also means we often times coach you to ask better questions. After all: after you finished your course at Winc you'll still have questions, for colleagues or for people on forums like Stack Overflow. If you're good at asking questions you'll get better answers more quickly.

What we also do is sometimes advise you to look at certain videos or pieces of content again. We don't do this to be mean or annoying. We do this because we believe the way we're pointing you towards is the best direction for you to become better, to learn and grow.

## Types of questions and strategy

There are different types of questions (press the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to open):

- Practical stuff, for example: 'Where can I see the archive of live lessons?'

    **Strategy:**

    1. check the FAQ first
    2. then just ask in Slack
- Theory, for example: 'I don't understand how `array.map` works, can someone enlighten me?'

    **Strategy:**

    First: read or view the sources you have on the theory. Then read or view them again. Then experiment with them. Do the examples work like you think they do? Why or why not? Take a (short) break and come back. Use a search engine (Google) to find alternative sources of information, sometimes getting the same information in another way makes things 'click'. If you're tired: take a nap or have a good night sleep.

    If you still have the question: ask it in a public Slack channel.

    **Don't wait too long**

    Some people, maybe that's you, are very independent and maybe a bit proud and want to solve each problem they have by themselves. That is of course your choice, but it's often not an *efficient* way of learning. So: if you're already banging your head against a concept for more than an hour or two: **please ask for help**.

- Understanding an exercise/assignment, for example: 'I don't know what I'm supposed to build or write'

    **Strategy:**

    Reread the exercise or assignment slowly. Exercises are for practicing stuff you just learned, and sometimes a bit more. Assignments are bigger and with them you can show that you're proficient in certain subjects.

    If an exercise or assignment is still unclear: please ask.

- Doing an exercise or assignment or writing code: 'I'm stuck doing exercise Y, at step 5'

    Most questions you'll have will fall in this category. Let's break this down even more, see below.

## Being stuck-questions

(press the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to open)

- 'I don't understand this error' or 'I don't understand why my code is not working'

    If the code you've written produces an error it's super important that you *understand* the error.

    [Why do I get this error?](@/why-do-i-get-this-error.md)

    After trying hard to find and fix the error yourself you can loosely use this template to ask a good question in this category:

    ```
    I'm doing exercise X, step Y. And I get the following error: 'Computer says no'.

    (now start a thread in Slack to write more details)

    I'm trying to do A and B. But when I do A I get the error.
    Here's my code: <your code> (in a Slack text snippet)
    The output I get from location C is D and I think that's right but I'm not
    sure..
    ```

- 'I don't know what to do next' or 'I don't know how to break this problem down into smaller parts'

    This is a hard problem and one that you're going to keep bumping into in your first years of programming. We've recorded a couple of live lessons on this, see below.

    Asking a good question in this category is something like:

    ```
    I'm doing exercise X, step Y and I'm not sure how to proceed.

    (now start a thread in Slack to write more details)

    I think I should split the problem into this part and that part and maybe make
    a separate part for Z. Does that sound logical? Would you do something
    differently?
    ```

- 'I think I can improve my code, but I'm not sure how'

    There are different ways of improving your code:

    - [use better names](@/wat-is-een-goede-naam-voor-een-functie-of-variabele.md)
    - [Don't Repeat Yourself](@/wat-is-dry.md) (includes live lesson)
    - [don't compare booleans](@/waarom-is-foo-==-true-niet-handig.md)
    - [don't use deeply nested conditionals](@/why-is-deeply-nested-conditional-code-bad.md)

    If you're not sure *if* your code can be improved or how you can ask in Slack. Be sure not to spoil assignments for your fellow students. One good way to share code is to 

    - ask for feedback
    - put your code on Github
    - share the link with the people that will give you feedback
