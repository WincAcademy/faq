# Why do I get this error?


Errors are good. Errors are information.

To understand why the code you're running produces an error you can take the following steps:

1. pinpoint **where** the error is happening (which file, which line, where on the line)

    The error can also occur at a location just *after* a problem in your code.

2. use `console.log` to view the values of things surrounding the error (very often the data is not what you think it is) and carefully look at the output in the console
3. if you're using a bit of syntax that you've just learned: re-read the documentation, some examples and how you use this
4. pinpoint **when** the error is happening (immediately? after you click a button? only on Sundays?, only with strings?)
5. read the error message slowly and carefully
6. understand each separate word of the error (if you don't know a word: look it up or ask)
7. try to understand the whole error
8. think of a theory about **why** this error is happening
9. **test** the theory by changing the data that you're working with
10. your experiment should give you information about what to do next, either fix the problem or maybe do another experiment

We've also given two (Dutch language) live-lessons on errors:
