    <h1>What are the best practices in the render function of a React component?</h1>

<p>You should try to keep your render functions simple and clean.</p>

<p>Don't</p>

<ul>
<li>define functions inside of the render method (they'll be defined again and again, making your code less fast)</li>
<li>put a lot of logic in your render function, some conditionals are fine, but do complex data transformations outside of the render function to make it easier to test</li>
</ul>
