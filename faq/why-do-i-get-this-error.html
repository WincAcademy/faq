    <h1>Why do I get this error?</h1>

<p>Errors are good. Errors are information.</p>

<p>To understand why the code you're running produces an error you can take the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>pinpoint <strong>where</strong> the error is happening (which file, which line, where on the line)</p>

<p>The error can also occur at a location just <em>after</em> a problem in your code.</p></li>
<li><p>use <code>console.log</code> to view the values of things surrounding the error (very often the data is not what you think it is) and carefully look at the output in the console</p></li>
<li>if you're using a bit of syntax that you've just learned: re-read the documentation, some examples and how you use this</li>
<li>pinpoint <strong>when</strong> the error is happening (immediately? after you click a button? only on Sundays?, only with strings?)</li>
<li>read the error message slowly and carefully</li>
<li>understand each separate word of the error (if you don't know a word: look it up or ask)</li>
<li>try to understand the whole error</li>
<li>think of a theory about <strong>why</strong> this error is happening</li>
<li><strong>test</strong> the theory by changing the data that you're working with</li>
<li>your experiment should give you information about what to do next, either fix the problem or maybe do another experiment</li>
</ol>

<p>We've also given two (Dutch language) live-lessons on errors:</p>

<p>Theory and strategy of errors:</p>
