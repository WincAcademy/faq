    <h1>I submitted an assignment, got feedback on it, but now it's gone, what happened?</h1>

<p>This situation can happen in the Winc Board.</p>

<p>This situation occurs if the following steps are taken:</p>

<ul>
<li>student submits an assignment</li>
<li>teacher or teacher assistant gives feedback and sets the assignment to 'not-passed'</li>
<li>the student gets an email telling them there's feedback</li>
<li>the student opens the link to the Winc Board</li>
<li>💥 the student presses the button 'Modify your answer'</li>
<li>both the original submisssion and the original feedback are now no longer available for the student or the teachers/teacher assistants</li>
</ul>

<p>When the student resubmits the assignment the teacher can see the old submission again.</p>

<p><strong>What to do if this happens to you:</strong></p>

<p>Inform the teacher or teacher's assistant that this (☝️) happened and ask them for the feedback they sent you. They'll send it and then you can improve your code and resubmit.</p>
