<h1 id="what-do-git-commands-do">What do git commands do?</h1>
<p>First, make sure you've read: <a href="https://faq.wincacademy.nl/what-is-git/">what is git?</a>. Now that you
know what git is for conceptually -- what are each of the commands for?</p>
<p>Think of git as an assistant that keeps track of your things for you, where
<em>things</em> are your files. One thing is very important: this assistant doesn't do
anything you don't ask them to do. Treat them like the robot that they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don't keep track of files that you haven't asked them to keep track
of;</li>
<li>They don't save changes unless you ask them to;</li>
<li>They don't revert changes unless you ask them to;</li>
<li>They don't communicate changes you told them about to other assistants unless
you ask them to.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's what all the commands are for!</p>
<h2 id="git-init">Git Init</h2>
<ul>
<li>Command</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">git</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> init
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Real Meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Initialize a git repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analogy</li>
</ul>
<p>Hire an assistant. They have a lot of skills but they haven't done anything
yet. They are just sitting there waiting for you to give them instructions.</p>
<h2 id="git-add">Git Add</h2>
<h3 id="command">Command</h3>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">git</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> add example_file.txt
</span></code></pre><h3 id="real-meaning">Real Meaning</h3>
<p>Stage one or multiple files.</p>
<h3 id="analogy">Analogy</h3>
<p>Ask the assistant to put some files on their desk.</p>
<h2 id="git-commit">Git Commit</h2>
<h3 id="command-1">Command</h3>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">git</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> commit</span><span style="color:#bf616a;"> -m </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">An example commit message</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">&quot;
</span></code></pre><h3 id="real-meaning-1">Real Meaning</h3>
<p>Commit some changes.</p>
<h3 id="analogy-1">Analogy</h3>
<p>Ask the assistant to create a record of the state of all the files that are
currently on their desk <em>and all the files that haven't changed</em> together. This
snapshot will be added to a list of snapshots the assistant holds on to,
together with the commit message (here: &quot;An example commit message&quot;).</p>
<h2 id="git-remote-add">Git Remote Add</h2>
<h3 id="command-2">Command</h3>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">git</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> remote add origin https://github.com/example_user/example_repository.git
</span></code></pre><h3 id="real-meaning-2">Real Meaning</h3>
<p>Add a remote named <code>origin</code> located at
<code>https://github.com/example_user/example_repository.git</code> to the list of
remotes.</p>
<h3 id="analogy-2">Analogy</h3>
<p>Tell the assistant about <em>another assistant of yours</em> that they should prepare
to communicate with. The assistant takes note of this on a list and does
nothing else yet.</p>
<h2 id="git-push">Git Push</h2>
<h3 id="command-3">Command</h3>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#65737e;"># The first time you need to tell git where you want to push to
# git push --set-upstream &lt;name_of_the_remote&gt; &lt;name_of_the_local_branch&gt;
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">git</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> push</span><span style="color:#bf616a;"> --set-upstream</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> origin master

</span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Afterwards you can just run the command without the extra info attached
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">git push
</span></code></pre><h3 id="real-meaning-3">Real Meaning</h3>
<p>Push current branch to the linked upstream branch. </p>
<h3 id="analogy-3">Analogy</h3>
<p>Ask the assistant to send their list of all the snapshots to the other
assistant you told them about earlier with <code>git remote add</code>. After doing this,
both assistants will have the same files and administration.</p>
