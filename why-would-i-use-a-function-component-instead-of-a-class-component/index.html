<p>In React you can create components with classes or with functions.</p>
<h2 id="without-react-hooks">Without React Hooks</h2>
<p>When you use a class component you have to write a bit more code but you get access to a lot more functionality.</p>
<p>However: if you don't need this functionality because your component is relatively simple it's better to just write a function. This both shows that your component is simple (to others that read your code) and it saves you time because you have to type less.</p>
<p>You can always convert a class component to a function component or back.</p>
<h2 id="with-react-hooks">With React Hooks</h2>
<p>If you use React Hooks you can still write function components, but you can get pretty much all the functionality that class components also have.</p>
<p>React Hooks is the future, but there's still a lot of class components that you will see.</p>
<p>Some people prefer using function components and React Hooks over class component.</p>
